Description of Projects
==========================

jtaylor1
------
Project 1 -- A program that uses a loop that outputs a table of angles in degrees and radians up to 360 degrees in increments of 10 degrees.

jtaylor2
------
Project 2 -- A program that takes the input file "romanstable.txt" and outputs a table of decimal numbers and their roman numeral equivalent from 1 to 1000.

jtaylor3
------
Project 3 -- This program implements the factorial and exponential functions using user input. Once inputed, creates a list of factorials and its approximation. The program also gives the exact e^x value.

jtaylor4
------
Project 4 -- Given the input file "klargest.txt", the program will find the k largest elements of the file. When the program reads the file, it will allocate an array of size k and store the k largest numbers in the array. If the next element is larger than the previous, that number will be modified and stored in the array. If not, it will be left alone.

jtaylor5
------
Project 5 -- A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward (eg: "racecar", "kayak", "neveroddoreven"). This program finds the largest palindrome in a string.

jtaylor6
------
Project 6 -- Using structs and pointers, this program finds the frequency of words in a file. Input file "words.txt", Output file "frequencies.txt".

jtaylor7
------
Project 7 -- Using linked lists, this program finds prime numbers up to 1000 using the sieve method. Here is some information on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>

jtaylorbonus
------
Project challenge! Reducing the size of the program "assignbonus.txt" without changing its functionality. "assignbonus.txt" is not an input file.
